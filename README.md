Ultimate D&D Resource Collection

Crowd-sourced D&D Resources from Reddit.

If you are the author of any of the resources in this collection and attribution has not been properly provided or you wish the file to be removed, please let me know so I can add attribution or remove the files as necessary.

This collection was created by redditors and has been placed here to avoid accidental removals from Google Drive and to keep bandwidth limits on Dropbox under control, I may not have been directly involved in adding a resource so I hold no responsibility for the content
